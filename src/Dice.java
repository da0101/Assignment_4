// A simple board game written in Java language under a title
// Garden Game. The consists of array of players(human players),
// a playing board in a form of NxN matrix and a pair of dice
// that is being used to determine who starts the game and later 
// which action a player should take. Players can either plant 
// flowers or trees, players can only plant anything on an empty 
// slot, player who does not have enough space to plant a tree 
// skip a turn, and player fills up their garden first wins the 
// game. Hence, clear description of rules is provided in the game.
// Overall the game structure consists of four classes that 
// hold the logic of the game.
